## WP Raw Output 

The following files are meant for Wordpress. If activated will let you upload a sliced PSD (zip file)
and will convert it to a WP Post. You can edit the post if you like. 

The theme in themes/raw_output is an "empty" theme. If you use it with the plugin on 
a stand alone instance of wordpress, you should see your PSDs converted to HTML just by
uploading the slice.
