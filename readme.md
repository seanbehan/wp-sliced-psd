## Sliced PSD 

The following files are meant for Wordpress. If the plugin is activated it will let you upload a sliced PSD (zip file)
and convert to a WP Post. You can edit the post if you like, preview and then publish. 

The theme in themes/sliced_psd is an "empty" theme. If you use it with the plugin on 
a stand alone instance of wordpress, you should see your last uploaded sliced PSD (converted to HTML) as the home page.

At the moment the plugin looks for files to be inside of a Sliced/ directory in the zip file.
