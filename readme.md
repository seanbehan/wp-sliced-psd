## Sliced PSD 

The following files are meant for Wordpress. If the plugin is activated it will let you upload a sliced PSD (zip file)
and convert to a WP Post. You can edit the post if you like, preview and then publish. 

The theme in themes/raw_output is an "empty" theme. If you use it with the plugin on 
a stand alone instance of wordpress, you should see your last uploaded sliced PSD (converted to HTML) as the home page.
